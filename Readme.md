Header inspired in medium
============================

![alt text](/images/medium_header.jpg)

I was very fascinated with the medium.com header. So, I decided to make my own script and use it on my projects. Then I thought It'd be a good idea to make it public and avaliable for others developers. So I released the code under the MIT license.

- HTML5 + CSS full screen design. 
- Image blurred when you scroll down.
- Text Headline moves and dissapear when you scroll down.

================
<b>Coming soon.</b><br />
In the coming version I'm going to include a code to make images blur automatically with Javascript. So you'll not need to use an image processor to make them blur. Yeeeh!
================
If you want to use the script, do it under the license. And let me know if your using my code, would be awesome to hear that!!! :P

Cheers!.
Jorge.
