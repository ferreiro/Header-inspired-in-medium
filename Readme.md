Header inspired in medium
============================

![alt text](/images/medium_header.jpg)

One website I usually visit is medium.com. One thing I was fascinated about medium is their articles header. I tried to find out similar code on the internet, but I didn't find it. For this reason, I decide to make my own code and release it under MIT license. 

### Features.

- Responsibe design made using HTML5 + CSS3.
- Header image blurred when you scroll down.
- Text gravity: dissapears and moves when you scroll down.

### Future improvements.

One cool thing I'll implement in the future is the creation of automatic blurred images. In the current version, you'll need to process or upload a blurred image in order to works as expected. 

You can use my code under MIT license. If you have some ideas and feedback, please, open an issue or write me an email: dividirporcero@gmail.com. Would be awesome to hear your ideas ;).

Cheers!.
Jorge.
