Header inspired in medium
============================

![alt text](/images/git_image.jpg)

I was very fascinated with the medium's header. So, I decided to make my own script and use it on my projects. Then I thought It'd be a good idea to make it public and avaliable for others developers. So I released the code under the MIT license.

If you want to use the script, do it under the license. And let me know if your using my code, would be awesome to hear that!!! :P

Cheers!.
Jorge.
